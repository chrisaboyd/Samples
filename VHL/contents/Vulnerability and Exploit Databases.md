# Vulnerability and Exploit Databases

How and where can we get more details to find known vulnerabilities and exploits?

## CVE Database

CVE = Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. The CVE database contains comprehensive info on all reported security vulnerabilities for a wide range of software and services.

[CVE Database](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html)

## National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

U.S. Government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data representing using SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol). Available [here](https://nvd.nist.gov). Also contains visualizations and high level overview of vulnerability data:
[Visualizations](https://nvd.nist.gov/general/visualizations)

## CVE Details 

Instead of searching for vulnerabilities, here we can search for specific versions of software to determine if they contain vulnerabilities. Can be found [here](https://www.cvedetails.com).

## CVSS Scoring 

Scoring is determined by three groupings of characteristics:

* Base Metric Group
  * Exploitability Metrics
    * Attack Vector - N (Network), A (Adjacent - Physical / Logical Local Network), L (Local), P (Physical)
    * Attack Complexity - L (Low Complexity, Simple), H (High Complexity, special preparation)
    * Privileges Required - N (None if no credentials are required), L (Low if user permissions required), H (High / root permissions required)
    * User Interaction - N (No user interaction required), R (Required if a user must do something)
  * Impact Metrics
    * Confidentiality Report - How much information is disclosed.
    * Integrity Impact - If an attacked can modify files impacting file integrity
    * Availability Impact - E.g. a vulnerable router that creates loss of network availability
  * Scope - If other resources can be affected by an exploited vulnerability.  U (Unchanged), C (Changed)
* Temporal Metric Group
  * Exploit Code Maturity - Likelihood of a vulnerability being attacked based on working exploit code. 
  * Remediation Level - If patches are available. U (Unavailable), W (Workaround), T (Temporary Fix), O (Official Fix)
  * Report Confidence - Degree of confidence in existence of vulnerability and credibility. 
* Environment Metric Group
  * Modified Base Metrics
  * Confidentiality Requirement
  * Integrity Requirement
  * Availability Requirement

### Severity Rating Scale

| Rating   | CVSS Score |
| -------- | ---------- |
| None     | 0          |
| Low      | 0.1 - 3.9  |
| Medium   | 4.0 - 6.9  |
| High     | 7.0-8.9    |
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 |



## Exploit Database Website

A great resource for finding known vulnerabilities and exploits is Exploit-db, maintained by Offensive Security. 
Can be searched by both CVE and OSVDB identifiers. 
Provides the vulnerable software as well to test exploits locally to see how they work and whether they require modification. 

* Searching for Unreal IRCD 3.2.8.1:
  * CVE: 2010-2075: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16922/
  * CVE: 2010-2075: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/13853/
  * Generally we might need to make modifications to the exploits to run successfully on a necessary target, such as IP address, or payload, or `bugs` introduced on purpose to prevent `script kiddies` from using them out of the box indiscriminately. 

## Searchsploit by Exploit-DB 

An offline resource on your local machine, provided by Searchsploit. Included with Kali Linux by default. 
Update the database first:

```bash
sudo searchsploit -u
sudo apt-get install exploitdb
```

* Searching for unreal:

  ```
  searchsploint unreal ircd
  ```

* Results are returned as paths like: `linux/remote/16922.rb` and `windows/dos/18011.txt` 

* These paths are relative to the stored directory, so we can `cat` the results:

  â€‹	`/usr/share/exploitdb/exploits`

### dRuby RMI Server 1.8 

Checking in searchsploit with an exact match:

```bash
searchsploit -e Ruby DRb RMI
# No results returned
searchsploit ruby
# 30 results get returned
searchsploit -e distributed Ruby
# 2 results returned that apply to this version
searchsploit -p 17058
# Searchs the specific path version, and adds the path to the clipboard
cat /usr/share/exploitdb/platforms/linux/remote/17058.rb
# Displays the vulnerability about this specific version
```
