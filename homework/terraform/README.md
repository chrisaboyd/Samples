# AWS infrastructure as code

Directory to host AWS IaC

Core configuration is located under `main`.
Deploys the following:

- VPC
- EKS
- Cluster Services
- (Optional) RDS

A Postgres Stateful Set was chosen to deploy in-cluster for this exercise simply to minimize footprint and cloud costs.  
RDS can be equally utilized, with the connection string provided to the services.
